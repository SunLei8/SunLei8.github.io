Welcome! In the AI-based Sensing, Networking and Data Services (AI-SENDS), we are working on powering sensing, networking, and data-driven actuation network with computational intelligence. The core of our research is developing predictive models for smart AI-powered agents to learn the environment and take actions based on their anticipated consequences. My vision is applied research, and we work with domain researchers from different expertise to leverage the developed method in different applications areas. Examples of our research include: (i) developing AI-enabled wireless networking protocols for unmanned aerial systems by predicting network topology, user behavior, spectrum mobility, and traffic distribution, (ii) developing a safety analysis framework for regular and self-driving cars to extract the overall safety of traffic flow from augmented video and time-stamped crash data, (iii) developing image-based security solutions to leverage fabrication variability of nano-resolution optical identifiers for securing supply chains and the Internet of Things, (iv) developing autonomous aerial sensing platform for fire modeling and control, (v) developing networking and computational nodes for sparse networking.
These projects involve concepts from information theory, signal processing, big data analysis, Bayesian inference, deep learning, graph theory, digital holography, and dimension reduction techniques.
These projects are supported by NSF, US Airforce Research Laboratory, USDA, and Arizona Commerce Authority. For more information, check out my research project here and feel free to send me an email at <arazi at clemson dot edu>.

Open Positions: We have multiple open positions (MS and PhD) in our research group. If you are interested, please email your CV to the email with topic "Application for open positions".
We also have funding to support part-time undergraduate and graduate research. If you have a good programming skill in MATLAB, Python, ROS, and C++, send us your CV.

 I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am also an affiliated
researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org).
